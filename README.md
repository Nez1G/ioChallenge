# ioChallenge
One of the winner projects of the 1st edition of ioAcademy Challenge

This was my first project made in Node js and my first time using technologies such as mongoDB and handlebars. The project
was developed on my free time, it had a deadline of 2 weeks and it was created to enter on the 1st edition of the 
ioAcademy Challenge. Basically the project consists of a ioStore (a fictional hardware store) and the objective was to
create interoperabilty in the app using 2 or more different payment APIs.
